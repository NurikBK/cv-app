  I recently worked with Nurzhan on a web development project, and I was thoroughly impressed with their skills and knowledge. They were able to take my design and turn it into a fully functional and responsive website using React and Material UI. Their attention to detail and ability to problem-solve made the project run smoothly, and the end result exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend Nurzhan for any web development projects.

  I had the pleasure of working with Nurzhan on a complex web development project that involved NextJS and SCSS. They were able to navigate through the challenges of the project with ease, and their ability to collaborate with the rest of the team made the project a success. Their understanding of the latest web development technologies and their attention to detail resulted in a website that is not only visually stunning but also highly functional. I highly recommend Nurzhan for any web development projects
